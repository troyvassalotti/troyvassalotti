# What's "Updog?"
_seriously, what is it?_

- ðŸ”­ Right now? Simplification and continued improvement (check my repos!).
- ðŸŒ± Coming up? SVG would be nice to learn in-depth.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaboration? I recently made an audio player/playlist component with JS/SASS/HTML if anyone wants to help me make it better. See it live at on this [demo site for my band](https://validcharacters.netlify.app/).
- ðŸ’¬ Speaking of which, ask me about my music! [Front Royal](https://www.frontroyalband.com) and [troy.](https://justtroy.bandcamp.com).
